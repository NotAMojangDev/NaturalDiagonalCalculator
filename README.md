# Natural Diagonal

A small plugin I made for the team at BTE Israel to calculate a "Natural Diagonal",

Current state:
Contains the command: /calculate-natural-diagonal <dimensions (Number, Number)>
The command has 2 aliases: /cnd, and /dn

### TODO: 
- [x] Calculate the Segments in a given line
- [ ] find the natural order of the segments
- [ ] Add WorldEdit Support
